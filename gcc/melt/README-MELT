## file melt/README.melt in melt-branch of GCC

Please read the wiki page on http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/MiddleEndLispTranslator
and my GCC summit 2007 paper 
Multi-stage construction of a global static analyser by Basile Starynkevitch, pages 143 - 152

This directory contains melt files. MELT is a dialect of Lisp compiled
into C code which should be compilable (by the strange melt-cc-script
invoking any GCC [or perhaps even another compiler?] with the
appropriate -fPIC and -I options (and using some melt-private-headers
directory containing the required *.h files from GCC source tree
needed to compile the MELT generated C code).

The MELT source files -a lisp like code- are *.melt and used to be
.bysl before April 9th 2009 (MELT branch rev 145716)



See the gcc/doc/melt.texi  file.
